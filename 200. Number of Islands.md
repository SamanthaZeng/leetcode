1. island is connected by 1 ---> dfs?
2. if one island has been calculated, change all the 1 in the island to 0 ---> will it change the result?  
no, since it will not change the connected 1 in other islands, it will not lead to wrong result.

how to do it?  
1. iterate the 2-d array, when we find '1', change it to '0'(will it lead to a wrong result? --- no, only new '1' is effective) and go to the four directions(up, down, left, right) to find new '1'. 
2. how to write function ? 
    - base case: if out of bounds, return 
    - recursive case: up, down, left, right
    - check if grid[row][col] == 1, or we will go to other islands.

code:  

    class Solution {
        public int numIslands(char[][] grid) {
            int rows = grid.length;
            int cols = grid[0].length;
            int count = 0;
            for(int i = 0; i < rows; i++){
                for(int j = 0; j < cols; j++){
                    if(grid[i][j] ==  '1'){
                        count += 1;
                        findIslands(i, j, grid);
                    }
                }
            }
            return count;
        }
        public void findIslands(int row, int col, char[][]grid){
            // make sure row and col is legal
            if(row >= 0 && col >= 0 && row < grid.length && col < grid[0].length){
                if(grid[row][col] == '1'){
                    grid[row][col] = '0'; 
                    //System.out.println("row:"+ row + ",col:"+ col);
                    findIslands(row + 1, col, grid);
                    findIslands(row - 1, col, grid);
                    findIslands(row, col + 1, grid);
                    findIslands(row, col - 1, grid);   
                }
            }
        }
    }
